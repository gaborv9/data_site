This includes reviewing early-stage designs, helping develop threat models.\n\nA World-Changing Company\n\nAt Palantir, we\u2019re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.\n\nThe Role\n\nOur products support some of the most important and impactful work in the world, including defense, intelligence, and commercial applications. We are trusted by our customers to protect their mission-critical information in the face of advanced persistent threats. The mission of the Application Security Team is to enable developers to be highly productive, agile, and produce the most secure software possible. Given the mission critical work that Palantir does, investments in application security have never been more important.\n\nAs an Application Security Engineer, you will be hands-on and have wide-ranging impact for the security of Palantir:\n\u2022   Product security reviews. You will perform full-scope security reviews of our current and future product and service portfolio. This includes whitebox, greybox, and blackbox assessments. You will work with offensive security teams, engineering teams, and other members of the InfoSec organization to harden our products against our dedicated adversaries. \n\u2022   Architecture and design. You will be the security subject matter expert for product architects and engineers. You will threat model, assess risks, and help implement security controls and mitigations to address identified issues. You will directly steer the design of our products to ensure we are secure-by-default. \n\u2022   Strategic security initiatives. You will be empowered to own transformational security initiatives that impact the whole company. Members of the Application Security Team have implemented software supply chain security controls (e.g., in-toto), implemented hardware-backed GPG key signing for commits, developed new security services, implemented security automation, or worked on massive-scale security problems. \n\u2022   Vulnerability identification and analysis.

The mission of the Application Security Team is to enable developers to be highly productive, agile, and produce the most secure software possible. Given the mission critical work that Palantir does, investments in application security have never been more important.\n\nAs an Application Security Engineer, you will be hands-on and have wide-ranging impact for the security of Palantir:\n\u2022  Product security reviews. You will perform full-scope security reviews of our current and future product and service portfolio. This includes whitebox, greybox, and blackbox assessments. You will work with offensive security teams, engineering teams, and other members of the InfoSec organization to harden our products against our dedicated adversaries. \n\u2022  Architecture and design. You will be the security subject matter expert for product architects and engineers. You will threat model, assess risks, and help implement security controls and mitigations to address identified issues. You will directly steer the design of our products to ensure we are secure-by-default. \n\u2022  Strategic security initiatives. You will be empowered to own transformational security initiatives that impact the whole company. Members of the Application Security Team have implemented software supply chain security controls (e.g., in-toto), implemented hardware-backed GPG key signing for commits, developed new security services, implemented security automation, or worked on massive-scale security problems. \n\u2022  Vulnerability identification and analysis. You will be responsible for finding new and novel ways to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities in our products. This includes static and dynamic code analysis, security scanning, investigation of security reports from InfoSec, our bug bounty program, or other trusted partners, and direct work with our incident response team on product security issues and incidents. \n\nThis role has wide-reaching impact, strong autonomy, and the resources and empowerment to make significant security improvements across all Palantir. The skills and background of successful candidates may vary highly, but curiosity, tenacity, and a drive to be a world-class security engineer are the underpinnings of our team.\u00a0\n",

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more.\u00a0\n\nWhat We're About\n\nAt its core, the Deployment Strategist role centers around leveraging data in operational and real-world action. Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to protect their troops, manufacture high-quality products, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver aid to refugees safely is to make better use of their data. Deployment Strategists are responsible for turning that hunch into reality.\n\nIf you believe in the transformational power of data and technology and in your own ability to bring that power to bear against complex problems, we want to meet you.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nAs a Deployment Strategist, you'll work as part of a driven and creative team of Engineers, Product Designers, and other Deployment Strategists to deploy software against the most challenging problems our world faces. Your mission is to synthesize disconnected streams of thought into a cohesive understanding of what the most important problem is, what the data means, what the product needs, what users are motivated by, and where the impact could be. \n\nDeployment Strategists are do-ers who immerse themselves in our customers' most intricate workflows, partner with customer teams and explore the data, and dive into the product landscape to enable us to scale. A select number of Deployments Strategists may also be deployed to Palantir internal teams and problems. In this role, the problems you'll tackle will require a curious and analytical mindset, a sharp intuition for product, and a strong degree of user empathy to ultimately empower our customers to make better decisions.\n",

        "descriptionPlain": "A World-Changing Company\n\nAt Palantir, we\u2019re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.\n\nThe Role\n\nForward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir\u2019s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like \u201cWhy are we delaying so many flights?\u201d or \u201cHow can we better identify instances of money laundering?\u201d As an FDSE, you\u2019ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world\u2019s most important industries and institutions. \n\nAs an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you\u2019ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. \n\nWhether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place \u2014 with the best colleagues \u2014 to learn how. You\u2019ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You\u2019ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You\u2019ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.\n\nOur Principles\n\n\u2022 Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.\n\u2022 Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter.\n\u2022 Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds \u2014 such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment\n\u2022 Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.\n\u2022 Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves.\n\u2022 Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge.\n\u2022 Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers.\n\nWhat We Value\n\n\u2022 Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science.\n\u2022 A highly analytical mindset and eagerness to solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.\n\u2022 Experience or interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems.\n\u2022 Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar.\n\u2022 Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.\n\u2022 Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.\n\u2022 Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location.\n\nLife at Palantir\n\nWe want every Palantirian to achieve their best outcomes, that\u2019s why we celebrate individuals\u2019 strengths, skills, and interests, from your first interview to your longterm growth, rather than rely on traditional career ladders. Paying attention to the needs of our community enables us to optimize our opportunities to grow and helps ensure many pathways to success at Palantir. Promoting health and well-being across all areas of Palantirians\u2019 lives is just one of the ways we\u2019re investing in our community. Learn more at Life at Palantir and note that our offerings may vary by region.\n\nIn keeping consistent with Palantir\u2019s values and culture, we believe employees are \u201cbetter together\u201d and in-person work affords the opportunity for more creative outcomes. Therefore, we encourage employees to work from our offices to foster connectivity and innovation. Many teams do offer hybrid options (WFH a day or two a week), allowing our employees to strike the right trade-off for their personal productivity. Based on business need, there are a few roles that allow for \u201cRemote\u201d work on an exceptional basis. If you are applying for one of these roles, you must work from the city and or country in which you are employed. If the posting is specified as Onsite, you are required to work from an office.\n\n\nPalantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world\u2019s hardest problems.\n\nPalantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone. If you are living with a disability (visible or not visible) and need to request a reasonable accommodation for any part of the application or hiring process, please reach out and let us know how we can help.\n",

We work together in realising a shared product vision, and regularly give feedback and critique to each other.\n\nDesigning at Palantir is a varied experience. On a given day, you might be: leading a design sprint for your product team; designing a micro-interaction to make a complex analytical task feel simple; and/or advocating for UX consistency by creating flexible, reusable UI components.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\n\u2022  Interaction and visual design. As a product designer, you'll be involved at every stage of design work. You'll help define early product concepts, flesh out the high-level workflow and micro-interactions of a feature, and execute on a crisp and effective visual design. You should have experience with mockup and prototyping tools.\n\u2022  User research. We frequently do informal user research, and value people who can be flexible with research processes and methodologies to achieve the right outcome.\n\u2022  Prototyping. You will prototype, both to communicate your designs and validate your decisions.\n\u2022  Partnering with engineers. We work closely with product and forward deployed engineers to realise our design ideas. You'll treat engineers as partners and collaborate with them to prototype and build out products.\n\u2022  Awareness of how software interfaces are built. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript is appreciated. You don't need to be an expert\u2014just fluent enough to collaborate with engineers, and know what's possible with frontend technologies. Resources and mentorship are available to designers who want to learn more.\n\nDesigners at Palantir have great autonomy over their work, so a wide skill set is necessary. However, many designers on the team are also passionate experts in one area.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nThe Palantir Design Team is responsible for the human experience of using our software. Our team is growing rapidly, but we're committed to creating a tight-knit team environment that fosters trust, integrity, empathy, and growth. We work together in realizing a shared product vision, and regularly give feedback and critique to each other.\n\nDesigning at Palantir is a varied experience. On a given day, you might be: leading a design sprint for your product team; designing a micro-interaction to make a complex analytical task feel simple; and/or advocating for UX consistency by creating flexible, reusable UI components.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\n\u2022  Interaction and visual design. As a product designer, you'll be involved at every stage of design work. You'll help define early product concepts, flesh out the high-level workflow and micro-interactions of a feature, and execute on a crisp and effective visual design. You should have experience with mockup and prototyping tools.\n\u2022  User research. We frequently do informal user research, and value people who can be flexible with research processes and methodologies to achieve the right outcome.\n\u2022  Prototyping. You will prototype, both to communicate your designs and validate your decisions.\n\u2022  Partnering with engineers. We work closely with product and forward deployed engineers to realize our design ideas. You'll treat engineers as partners and collaborate with them to prototype and build out products.\n\u2022  Awareness of how software interfaces are built. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript is appreciated. You don't need to be an expert\u2014just fluent enough to collaborate with engineers, and know what's possible with frontend technologies. Resources and mentorship are available to designers who want to learn more.\n\nDesigners at Palantir have great autonomy over their work, so a wide skill set is necessary. However, many designers on the team are also passionate experts in one area. You might be the kind of designer who ships code every week, or the kind of designer who shares detailed user research findings with your team.\n",

PREs make this easier by building self-serve tools/processes that allow product users to better understand what the blockers are (e.g., whether a build failing is access-related or a product bug).</li><li>Product Reliability Systems and Process: PREs are amongst the most seasoned users of our deployment and stability infrastructure, which means they often identify opportunities for additional functionality that would improve operational efficiency. An important part of the PRE role is partnering with other infrastructure and operational teams across Palantir to provide this input and, where appropriate, directly deliver features that will benefit product operations (e.g., developing a system that automatically de-duplicates product alerts and enables teams to prioritize and document critical information).</li>"

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nSoftware Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organisations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer you\u2019ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Apollo, or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organisation is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties.\n\nSWE principles include: \n\n\u2022 Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.\n\u2022 Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds \u2014 such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.\n\u2022 Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage.

Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you\u2019re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast \u2014 you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\n\nThe Role\n\nPalantir's defense product vertical builds mission-critical products for the modern warfighter. We provide a complete ecosystem where customers can securely integrate and visualize their data, and build sophisticated, full-fledged programs such as common operating pictures, alert-triaging inboxes, and resource allocation planning tools driven by rich-ML models. Our customers use our defense offering to perform rich analyses that drive core operations within their organizations - these programs are relied upon for daily operations in the command centers and battlefronts of militaries across the world. \n\nThis is a frontend engineering role focused on application development for our defense product offering, where you will be responsible for crafting the applications that organizations use every day to keep their countries safe. You will be architecting and developing interfaces to make sophisticated, data-intensive workflows both powerful and approachable, including to non-technical users. You may spend one day talking to users to better understand their needs and identifying product gaps to improve. The next day, you might find yourself putting that customer context to use and brainstorming how to handle intricate UX needs with your teammates. You\u2019ll regularly face sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and finding an incremental path to shipping the new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, and work with backend engineers in developing them together. You\u2019ll be constantly exploring new horizons and building new skills in service of real world needs: between type theory, operational transforms, 2D and 3D mapping, UI design systems, high-scale graphics rendering, evidence-based performance optimization, and the never-ending need to decompose user asks into rich, sophisticated, and maintainable software, there is always a new challenge to be faced.\n\n\n\nCore Responsibilities\n\nAs a frontend engineer working on our defense product offering, you will be involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping.\n",
